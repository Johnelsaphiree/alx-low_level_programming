This 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings project tasks will start from this README.md file and the tasks are listed below:-
alx-low_level_programming is the Repository.
0x05-pointers_arrays_strings is the project.
Files: 0-reset_to_98.c, 1-swap.c, -strlen.c, 3-puts.c, 4-print_rev.c, 5-rev_string.c, 6-puts2.c, 7-puts_half.c, 9-strcpy.c, 8-print_array.c
Tasks 0. 98 Battery st. mandatory Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);

Don't swap horses in crossing a stream mandatory Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);

This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read mandatory Write a function that returns the length of a string.
Prototype: int _strlen(char *s); FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strlen. Run man strlen to learn more.

File: 2-strlen.c

I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them mandatory Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
Prototype: void _puts(char *str); FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.

File: 3-puts.c

I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear mandatory Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
File: 4-print_rev.c

A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes mandatory Write a function that reverses a string.
Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
File: 5-rev_string.c

Half the lies they tell about me aren't true mandatory Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void puts2(char *str);

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
Directory: 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
File: 6-puts2.c

Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half mandatory Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void puts_half(char *str); The function should print the second half of the string If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2

Directory: 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
File: 7-puts_half.c

Arrays are not pointers mandatory Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n); where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array You are allowed to use printf

File: 8-print_array.c

strcpy mandatory Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src); Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
Return value: the pointer to dest FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcpy. Run man strcpy to learn more.
